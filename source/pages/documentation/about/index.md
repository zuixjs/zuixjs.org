üêù `zuix.js` is a lightweight library for creating modular and component-based websites or applications
using standard HTML, CSS and JavaScript with some useful extras that will speed up development time
and improve code reusability and maintainability.

It's framework-agnostic, and it doesn't require any bundler, package manager, or transpiling to work; all the
magic is already provided by the library itself and can be used with your favorite web development stack.

Designed to take your website's speed to the max, it will automagically load components and dependencies
only when they are actually about to be used.

Designed to support you in writing truly reusable components without creating messy code that mixes
JavaScript with HTML and CSS in a single file.  

Components can also be loaded directly from external websites, making the possibilities of sharing and reusing them
infinite across a network of sites.  

Write once and reuse anywhere without ever duplicating a single file!
