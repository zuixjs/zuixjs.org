üêù `zuix.js` is a lightweight library for creating modular and component-based websites or applications
using standard HTML, CSS and JavaScript with some useful extras that will speed up development time
and improve code reusability and maintainability.

It's framework-agnostic, and it doesn't require any bundler, package manager, or transpiling to work; all the
magic is already provided by the library itself and can be used with your favorite web development stack.

Designed to take your website's speed to the max, it will automagically load components and dependencies
only when they are actually about to be used.

Designed to support you in writing truly reusable components without creating messy code that mixes
JavaScript with HTML and CSS in a single file.  

Components can also be loaded directly from external websites, making the possibilities of sharing and reusing them
infinite across a network of sites.  

Write once and reuse anywhere without ever duplicating a single file!


### Features in brief

- Components loading either from a local or remote servers
- View templates (featuring hot swapping)
- Data binding
- Lazy loading of components and dependencies
- Events, Behaviors, Refresh *@* Handlers, "scoped" scripts
- Automatic events unbinding
- Resource loader with caching
- Integrated DOM helper
- Animations and transitions handling
- Inline components definition
- Standalone components

üß∞ `zuix-cli` is a tool for the command line for creating new projects, adding pages or components,
bundling and compressing into a single HTML file all resources used in a page, either local or remote ones.
Project starter templates are using [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev/) as site generator, which works very nicely
together with *zuix.js*.

**Features in brief**

- Page bundling (components, styles, scripts)
- Assets mirroring (creates a local copy of external resources such as scripts, images and videos)
- *Eleventy* site generator:
  * Integrated web server (*BrowserSync*)
  * Automatic rebuild and client refresh on files change
  * Partials and include
  * Front matter and external data files
  * Multiple template languages:
    - [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/introduction/)
    - [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html)
    - Markdown
    - Handlebars
    - Mustache
    - Pug
    - and more...
  * Custom filters and shortcodes
- [LESS](https://lesscss.org/) to CSS style compiler
- Page indexing and search engine [Fuse.js](https://fusejs.io/)
- Code linting and minifying
- Service worker generator for assets pre-caching and other optimizations
- Responsive starter templates optimized for both desktop and mobile
- Progressive Web App (PWA) templates with 95-100/100/100/100 score in *Lighthouse* test for mobile devices
