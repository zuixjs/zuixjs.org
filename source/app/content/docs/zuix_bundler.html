#### App bundling <i class="material-icons mdl-color-text--grey-500">folder</i>

Bundling is the process of collecting all resources used in a page and then compiling them into a single and optimized file.
This will drastically narrow down the number of network requests the browser will make to complete the page loading,
thus resulting in a faster startup.

There are actually two way of doing this:

- **In-Browser** bundler:
this method does not require any build tool nor plugins, it just works in the browser as-is.

- **Web-Starter** bundler:
is the [zuix-web-starter](https://github.com/zuixjs/zuix-web-starter) bare template with *inline bundle generation*
and a bunch of extra features and enhancements. It requires *Node.js* to be installed.

This documentation will only cover the in-browser bundling method.


##### In-Browser bundling

When a website is ready for production you can decide to bundle it in order to gain better performances.
All of its components and resources will be crunched into a single file and loaded from memory rather than from network/localhost.

###### Step by step guide

Include the **zuix-bundler** extension script in your page right after the main *zuix* script inclusion:

```html
<script src="js/zuix.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://zuixjs.github.io/zuix/js/zuix-bundler.min.js"></script>
```

After adding this script you can reload the page and generate the application bundle by typing in the **browser console** the command

```javascript
zuix.saveBundle()
```

This will create and save the **app.bundle.js** file to the *Downloads* folder.

Copy the generated file to your website root and include it right after the main *zuix* script inclusion.

```html
<script src="js/zuix.min.js"></script>
<script src="app.bundle.js"></script>
```

Remove the `zuix-bundler` script inclusion from the page after the bundle is created.


###### Remarks

When using *lazy-loading* only components loaded so far will be included in the bundle (incremental bundling).

To force inclusion of all components/resources used in the page, issue the following commands in the console:

```javascript
// disable lazy-loading
zuix.lazyLoad(false)
// force loading of all components
zuix.componentize()
// create the bundle
zuix.saveBundle()
```

Also external JavaScript libraries and CSS files can be included in the page bundle. In order to achieve this,
remove the `<script src="..."></script>` or `<link rel="stylesheet">` and instead use the method `zuix.using(...)` to load the script/css.

```javascript
// Loading a .css style
const flaCss = 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/flex-layout-attribute/1.0.3/css/flex-layout-attribute.min.css';
zuix.using('style', flaCss, function(res, styleObject) {
  console.log("Added Flex Layout Attributes CSS.", res, styleObject);
});
// Loading a .js script
const momentJs = 'https://momentjs.com/downloads/moment.js';
zuix.using('script', momentJs, function(res, scriptObject){
  console.log("Added Moment.js.", res, scriptObject);
});
// Loading a zuix component
zuix.using('component', '@lib/extensions/animate_css', function(res, componentContext){
  console.log("Added AnimateCSS extension for zUIx.", res, componentContext);
});
```

If the `zuix.using` method is called on a resource that was already loaded, it will just ignore the request.

This method can also be used to create **self-contained components** that can be loaded without having to worry about external dependencies to include.

###### In-browser bundling examples

You can see how in-browser bundling is used in the following projects:

- <a href="https://github.com/zuixjs/zuix-web-flix"><i class="material-icons">link</i> **WebFlix**</a>
*Web app template inspired to Netflix mobile app (PWA)*
- <a href="https://github.com/zuixjs/zuix-html-pwa"><i class="material-icons">link</i> **HTML-PWA**</a>
*Web app template of a modern mobile app, made with just HTML, CSS, JavaScript (PWA)*
