#### App bundling <i class="material-icons mdl-color-text--grey-500">folder</i>

Bundling is the process of collecting all resources used in a page and then compiling them into a single, optimized file.
This will drastically reduce the number of network requests the browser will have to do to complete the page loading
and that will so load the page faster.

There are actually two way of doing this:

- **In-Browser** bundler:
this method does not require any build tool nor plugins, it just works in the browser as-is.

- **Web-Starter** bundler:
is the [zuix-web-starter](https://github.com/zuixjs/zuix-web-starter) bare template, with a bunch of extra features and enhancements.
It requires *Node.js* to be installed.

This documentation will only cover the in-browser bundling method.


##### In-Browser bundling

Usually when a website or application is ready for production you can decide to bundle it in order to gain better performances.
All of its components and resources will be crunched into a single file and loaded from memory rather than from network/localhost.

###### Step by step guide

Include the **zuix-bundler** extension script in your page right after the main *zuix* script inclusion:

```html
<script src="js/zuix.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://zuixjs.github.io/zuix/js/zuix-bundler.min.js"></script>
```

After adding this script you can reload the page and generate the application bundle by typing in the **browser console** the command

```javascript
zuix.saveBundle()
```

This will create and save the **app.bundle.js** file to the *Downloads* folder.

Copy the generated file to your website root and include it right after the main *zuix* script inclusion.

```html
<script src="js/zuix.min.js"></script>
<script src="app.bundle.js"></script>
```

Remove the `zuix-bundler` script inclusion from the page after the bundle is created.


###### Remarks

When using *lazy-loading* only components loaded so far will be included in the bundle (incremental bundling).

To force inclusion of all components/resources used in the page, issue the following commands in the console:

```javascript
// disable lazy-loading
zuix.lazyLoad(false)
// force loading of all components
zuix.componentize()
// create the bundle
zuix.saveBundle()
```

Also external JavaScript libraries and CSS files can be included in the page bundle. In order to achieve this,
remove the `<script src="..."></script>` or `<link rel="stylesheet">` and use the method `zuix.using(...)` instead to load the script/css.

```javascript
// Loading a .css style
const flaCss = 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/flex-layout-attribute/1.0.3/css/flex-layout-attribute.min.css';
zuix.using('style', flaCss, function(res, styleObject) {
  console.log("Added Flex Layout Attributes CSS.", res, styleObject);
});
// Loading a .js script
const momentJs = 'https://momentjs.com/downloads/moment.js';
zuix.using('script', momentJs, function(res, scriptObject){
  console.log("Added Moment.js.", res, scriptObject);
});
// Loading a zuix component
zuix.using('component', '@lib/extensions/animate_css', function(res, componentContext){
  console.log("Added AnimateCSS extension for zUIx.", res, componentContext);
});
```

If the `zuix.using` method is called on a resource that was already loaded, it will just ignore the request.

This method is also used to create **self-contained components** that can be loaded without having to worry about external dependencies to include.
