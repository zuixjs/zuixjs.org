### `Zuix` class

This is the main framework class which is accessible though the global object `zuix`.
The `zuix` object takes care of parsing all `data-ui-load` and `data-ui-include`
attributes found in the HTML document and it loads components and contents accordingly.

Beside that, `zuix` offers a few methods that can be used in the JavaScript code to
accomplish various tasks such as:
<ul>
    <li>Getting a reference to any loaded component for using its methods and/or listening to its events</li>
    <li>Dynamically loading or create components</li>
    <li>Selecting and managing DOM elements and events, also providing caching and automatic resource disposal</li>
    <li>Adding global hooks to handle or extend every single aspect of the life-cycle of components and contents</li>
</ul>
